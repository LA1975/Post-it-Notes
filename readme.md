# Post It Notes style todo app

## Introduction - why this project
I am wanting to transition from teaching to software development.  Upon completion of PGCert (Information Technology), I was offered a job at a startup that was exciting and seemed such a wonderful supportive team to launch my new career, it ticked all the boxes for me including being fully remote.

I turned it down.  Why? 

Something was happening with my health, a kind of allergic reaction, I didn't know what exactly at the time but my instinct was telling me I might not get better quickly and I wanted to make sure I could start my new job at my best and not be a drag on the team.  Turns out I was right within 2 weeks I ended up in hospital very ill barely able to stand or walk far, unable to brush my own hair or drive a car.  Turns out I had developed dermatomyositis (immune system attacking muscles and skin) which is often associated with the presence of cancer.  Turns out it was the case for me.  Triple-negative breast cancer.

So now I am facing at least 6months of chemo to treat both conditions and then a double mastectomy.

I cannot work teaching until my muscles repair (if they ever do).  So while lying in hospital I made a decision...I can't control all this stuff happening to me.   I CAN still type, I CAN still code.

I need a project.  

I came up with lots of ideas, alot of them relating to what I was going through as a patient.  I decided it isn't healthy to make my entire life about my cancer and disability so I wanted one fun, one I could break down into to little bite sized chunks that I can easily manage, something where I can practice and embedd my newly acquired skills but extend them further to encourage skill growth.

I love stationary and to-do lists and post-it notes


 (I know fun?!?) so when I saw a tutorial on YouTube by codefoxx https://youtu.be/_B-54mvPup4  https://github.com/iamcodefoxx  I couldn't resist.

This tutorial is just for a simple front-end app and I enjoyed it, however, I soon started to make a list in my head of all the changes and extra features I would like to have in it.

So I decided to see how far I could take this simple project and see how many features I could add.

Trello board here:
https://trello.com/invite/b/pK1NFTcX/7188f18abbaa688646b2421f6e3bfe42/post-it-notes-style-todo-app

Initially just creating a front end app .
html, css, js, bootstrap.

Changes to do:
- changed "new note" button to icon
- keeps becoming default key on load- annoying when using mulitple apps screen
- add delete icon to finished sticky
- implement simple wysiwyg for not input
- ability to attach docs, images to note
- ability to edit note without deleting
- ablity to add todo checklist/ sub tasks on note
- summary todo list option instead of layout
- settings to change font of completed note (or just leave to wysiwyg?)
- set due date


implement backend:
- login user settings
- new user creation
- server side cookies
- database storage - SQLite? to store settings
- investigate integration with google/MS365 todo etc
- admin control page
- email alerts
- add tags/labels

future ideas:
- add pomodoro timer for tasks export data for productivity tracking
- incorporate into Kandban board style  
- drag and drop functionality
